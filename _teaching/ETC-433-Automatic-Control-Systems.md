Taught - (S19, S21): In this course, the students will develop an understanding of the basic principles of automatic control theory, with emphasis on time and frequency domain methods. The principle of the elements of control systems will be implemented in Python and/or MATLAB. The coding and representing the automatic control algorithms will be applied to case-studies (Temperature Control in this course) for various engineering problems. Data fitting and differential equation representation of systems from several engineering disciplines will be studied. The students will study the principle elements of control systems such as: Sensors, Controls (P, PI and PID), and Actuators and test them in lab environment.

Learning Goals:
======
To provide some theoretical knowledge for analysis and design of simple automatic control systems. At the end of the course, the students should learn:
1. Automatic control implementation in Python
2. Basic Feedback Configuration and Temperature control in Ar-
duino and Python
3. System Modelling, Laplace Transform, first and second order
model estimation in Python,
4. Controller Design in Python (on/off, P, PI, PID)
