Taught - (F19, F20): Introduction to theory, analysis and design of electric circuits. Units and definitions. Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws. Analysis of resistive circuits. Circuit analysis using superposition, nodal and mesh methods, Norton Thevenin theorems, and current and voltage divider rules. Transient and sinusoidal steady state response of circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

Learning Goals:
------
By the end of the semester:

1. Students will demonstrate the ability to apply knowledge, linear algebra and complex variables.
2. Students will demonstrate an ability to design several typical circuits often found within a larger system to meet desired needs.
3. Students will demonstrate the ability to identify, formulate, and solve circuit-level engineering problems.
4. Students will demonstrate an ability to communicate effectively in both written and oral form.
5. Students will demonstrate an ability to compute complex arithmetic, frequency responses, and perform parametric studies
using modern engineering tools such as MATLAB and Electronics Workbench.
