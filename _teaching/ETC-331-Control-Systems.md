Taught - (F18, S19, F19, F20, S21, F21): Basic control systems studied using Laplace transforms. Principles of electro-mechanical control systems (electrical and mechanical), measuring means, components and their characteristics, and controller characteristics. Analysis of a control system by the frequency/phase responses and stability criteria.

Learning Goals:
------
To provide theoretical knowledge for analysis and design of simple classical control systems. At the end of the course, the students should learn:
1. Develop an understanding of the basic principles of classical control theory, with emphasis on time and frequency (Laplace) domain methods.
2. Apply control system theory to case-studies from several engineering disciplines.
3. Study of principle elements of control systems such as: Sensors, Controls, and Actuators by utilizing the fundamentals of classical control systems using Laplace transforms, root locus, frequency/phase responses, stability criteria, and application of professional ethics.
