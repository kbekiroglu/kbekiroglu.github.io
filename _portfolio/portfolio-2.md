The proposed innovation entails the development of a low-cost, IoT-based wireless online structural monitoring system for asphalt, aimed at enabling engineers to continuously monitor the structural health of roads and develop and organize necessary treatment interventions in a timely manner. The accurate evaluation of pavement response and performance is highly dependent on the continuous acquisition of high-quality measurements, including pressure, temperature, humidity, among other measures. In light of this, real-time data monitoring and measurement are essential for transportation agencies and road engineers to design more durable pavements or devise solutions to prevent asphalt structural failure.

The collection of various data types and the integration of information from different sections of asphalt material in highways or other roads can provide significant insights into the quality of the road or asphalt. To this end, a robust apparatus has been developed for this project, aimed at facilitating continuous monitoring and evaluation of the asphalt's structural health. Through this innovative approach, engineers and transportation agencies can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of structural failure, ensuring the long-term durability and safety of roads and highways.

Overall, this project represents a significant contribution to the field of road engineering, providing an innovative solution that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach road and pavement monitoring and maintenance. By leveraging cutting-edge IoT technology and data analytics, this system can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of road engineering and pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient infrastructure system.
