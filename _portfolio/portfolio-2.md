======
I am pleased to share with you my experience in developing control systems and algorithms for the [Ninja Espresso & Coffee Barista System](https://www.ninjakitchen.com/exclusive-offer/CFN601WBKT/ninja-espresso-coffee-barista-system/), which is currently available in the market. From prototype development to mass production, I successfully developed and implemented algorithms (in C++, Arduino, and Python) for all features of the product, including cascade temperature control, flow control, failure detection, altitude calibration, and low pass filter.

During prototype development, I obtained most of the sensors and AC/DC motor drivers from the market and combined them to model the final product. I then conducted most of the testing on this prototype before implementing the algorithms in the actual machine. As part of my responsibilities, I defined and developed the system flow of the product features and developed testing code (Arduino, Python, and MATLAB) for prototypes. I closely worked with the software engineer to program these features into the final product and documented each feature.

I also identified possible risks and took software-related actions, such as developing error states for the unit and taking real-time actions based on sensor readings. I researched and implemented new ideas/algorithms and approaches to the prototypes and final product and adapted new features in both software and hardware to speed up the research process. Additionally, I supported the testing team and product design team by developing some test software.

Finally, I investigated the root cause of failures and searched for possible solutions. I analyzed the risks related to the failures and proposed solutions to minimize them. I also owned and managed the development of prototype and testing tools, including a Python application and an R-pi/Arduino apparatus to speed up the testing process.

Overall, my experience developing control systems and algorithms for the Ninja Espresso & Coffee Barista System has given me valuable skills in defining and developing product features, testing, documentation, risk management, and troubleshooting.
