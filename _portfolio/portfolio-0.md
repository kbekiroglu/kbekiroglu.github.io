======
As the lead control systems and algorithm development researcher, I worked on:

* Barista Assist Technology: Implemented innovative features to enhance the user experience, assisting with precise coffee brewing.
* Milk Froth Control Algorithms: Developed advanced algorithms for consistent and customizable milk frothing.
* Temperature Control for All Coffee Brews: Designed a robust temperature control system ensuring optimal brewing conditions for various coffee types.
* Super Consistent PID for Espresso Brews: Created a highly accurate PID control system for perfect espresso extraction.
* Error/Fault Detection Algorithms: Developed comprehensive algorithms for real-time monitoring and fault detection to ensure product reliability.
* Signal Processing Methods: Implemented sophisticated signal processing techniques for accurate sensor data analysis.

From the initial concept to mass production, I played a key role in the following:
---

* Prototype Development: Integrated market-available sensors and motor drivers to create a working prototype. Conducted extensive testing and refined the system before implementing it in the final product.
* System Flow Definition: Defined and developed the system flow of the product's features, collaborating closely with software engineers to implement these features in the final product.
* Testing and Documentation: Developed testing code (C++, Arduino, Python, MATLAB) and documented each feature thoroughly.
* Risk Management and Troubleshooting: Identified potential risks, developed error states, and proposed solutions to minimize failures. 
* Managed the development of prototype and testing tools, including Python applications and an R-pi/Arduino apparatus, to streamline the testing process.

Overall, my experience with the Ninja Luxe Cafe has equipped me with valuable skills in product feature definition, system testing, risk management, and advanced algorithm development.
