Demonstrated leadership in guiding cross-functional teams to design and implement advanced control systems and algorithms across a broad portfolio of consumer electronics. Led the end-to-end development lifecycle—from prototyping and modeling to embedded implementation and mass production—delivering high-performance, reliable, and scalable solutions across multiple product categories.

Leadership/Manager Portfolio
==================

As Director of Control Systems at SharkNinja, I established and scaled the cross-functional Control Systems Engineering team that designs and develops intelligent software and embedded algorithms for consumer electronics. This portfolio summarizes multiple product categories, each integrating unique control challenges, system modeling, and sensor fusion technologies.

## System-Level Responsibilities

From early-stage ideation to production ramp-up, the team has led:

- **Prototype Development:** Built with R-Pi, Arduino, microcontrollers, C++, Python, and MATLAB. Integrated real-world sensors and drivers.
- **System Flow Definition:** Collaborated with embedded software engineers and defined complete state flows with required algorithms for functionalities defined by the product team.
- **Testing & Tooling:** Developed Python/RPi-based testing rigs and validation code. Designed and coded many user interfaces for the testing team to accelerate testing and data collection for hardware-in-the-loop validation.
- **Risk & Fault Handling:** Modeled system failure cases, error logging/logics, and safe-state fallback mechanisms.
- **Documentation & Specs:** Authored system specifications, feature flowcharts, test plans, and contributed to various patents.
