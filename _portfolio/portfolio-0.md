Demonstrated leadership in guiding cross-functional teams to design and implement advanced control systems and algorithms across a broad portfolio of consumer electronics. Led the end-to-end development lifecycle—from prototyping and modeling to embedded implementation and mass production—delivering high-performance, reliable, and scalable solutions across multiple product categories.

Leadship/Manager Portfolio
==================

As Director of Control Systems at SharkNinja, I established and scaled the cross-functional Control Systems Engineering team that design/develop intelligent software and embedded algorithms for consumer electronics. This portfolio summurizes the multiple product categories, each integrating unique control challenges, system modeling, and sensor fusion technologies.
