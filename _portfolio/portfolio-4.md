Identification of a parsimonious model of systems can be difficult depending on the nature of the data and/or priors available. It is difficult since, very often, the available data is noisy and has missing samples. Therefore, we are investigating a new randomized parsimonious system identification algorithm for Linear/Nonlinear systems. A new atomic norm Anormapproach has been used for proposed randomized algorithms.


Theoretical and Implementation Studies in the Field of Linear System Identification:
------
* Sparse System Identification Algorithm via Atomic Norm
* Modeling of health problems (Physical Activity, Smoking Behavior, Cancer, etc.)
* Developing a method for ghost elimination in bearing-only tracking for passive radars
* Investigating a new recursive model learning algorithm for thermal dynamical models
* Research on time-series forecasting methods
* System identification theory for testing/classification of the materials
