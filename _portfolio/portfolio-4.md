The proposed innovation is a low-cost IoT-based wireless online structural monitoring system of asphalt that allows engineers to continuously monitor the asphalt/roads' structural health and develop/organize required treatment on time. Evaluating the asphalt/pavement response and performance depend on continuously acquiring the required high-quality measurements. The pavement performance evaluation is a function of many measures such as pressure, temperature, humidity etc. Having these measurements and monitoring the real-time data allows transportation agencies and road engineers to design a more durable pavement or to come up with solutions before the asphalt structural failure. Therefore, gathering the various data types and combining all information from the different sections of asphalt material in highways or other roads could provide important information about the road/asphalt quality. To that end, an apparatus is developed for this project.
