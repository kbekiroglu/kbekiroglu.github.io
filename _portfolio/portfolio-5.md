We are a group of theoretical computer scientists, software engineers, control system engineers, and data scientists. We investigate computationally efficient anomaly detection and fault detection algorithms for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Mainly, we are aiming to use time-series data in real time to detect and eliminate the anomalies in the network.
