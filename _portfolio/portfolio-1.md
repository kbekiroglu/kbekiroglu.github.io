Conceptualized/Designed/Implemented various software/signal processing/sensing tools and controllers for Ninja Heated products. Focused on Ninja brand in heated kitchen applicense and recently working on coffee and water product.

[Ninja Espresso & Coffee Barista System](https://www.ninjakitchen.com/exclusive-offer/CFN601WBKT/ninja-espresso-coffee-barista-system/)
======

* Successfully developed control systems (e.g., cascade temperature control, flow control) and algorithms (e.g., failure detection, altitude calibration, low pass filter) for all features of one Ninja Coffee Machine in the market. From prototype development to mass production, algorithms were developed (in C++, Arduino, and Python) and implemented in the final product.
* Owned/Managed the prototype and testing tools development. A Python application and an R-pi/Arduino apparatus were developed to speed up the testing process.

Responsibilities:
------
* Define and develop the system flow of the product features.
* Develop testing code (Arduino, Python and MATLAB) for prototypes and improve the system flow based on the findings. 
* Document each feature and closely work with the software engineer to program these features into the final product.
* Identify the possible risk and take software-related actions. Develop error states for the unit and take real-time actions based on the real-time sensor readings.
* Research and implement new ideas and approaches to the prototypes and final product.
* Adapt the new features both in SW and hardware to speed up the research process.
* Support testing team and product desing team by developing some test Software.
