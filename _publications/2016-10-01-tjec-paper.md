The objective of this study is twofold: to approximate a model of a blimp, and to use this model to develop a
setup to track a target with the blimp that is outfitted with a wireless camera and radio-controlled propellers. This article
presents a powerful method to track any moving or stationary target with an unmanned aerial vehicle by combining the
advantages of the proportional derivative (PD) controller, continuously adaptive mean shift (Camshift) algorithm, and
pulse width modulation (PWM) method.
