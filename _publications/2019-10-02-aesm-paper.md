In precision agriculture, fusing low-resolution Remote Sensing (RS) information with proximal sensors provided by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can help increase productivity, reduce cost, and optimize resources. However, sensor cost and range emerge as a major concern. Consequently, optimal sensor placement has emerged as key. Here we examine it and propose Sensor Placement Algorithm with Range Constraints (SPARC) as a potential solution.
