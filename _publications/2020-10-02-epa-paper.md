This study presents an extremum seeking-proportional–integral and derivative (ES-PID) controller design for
brushless direct current motors and its implementation in electric vehicles. The ES-PID controller aims to simultaneously
maintain a speed set-point and reduce torque ripples in the presence of load-torque disturbances. The proposed ES-PID
combines the simplicity of a PID controller with an extremum seeking approach, a model-free optimisation approach, thereby
resulting in an optimal controller that can be realised on simple hardware (with limited computing power and memory). In
addition, a theoretical analysis of the proposed ES-PID control scheme in terms of stability and convergence is also presented.
Performance evaluation of the proposed ES-PID controller using both simulations and hardware experiments are presented.
The results clearly illustrate the ability of the controller to track speed set-point and reduce torque ripples in the presence of
load-torque variations.
