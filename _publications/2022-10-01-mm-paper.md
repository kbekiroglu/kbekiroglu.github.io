An artificial pancreases (AP) is a device for managing diabetes through automated insulin infusion. The control algorithm is the heart of the AP that computes the insulin infusion based on blood glucose measurements. In this article, we investigate the role of multimedia data to enable the advanced control techniques that could personalize AP in elderly type 2 diabetes patients. The performance is evaluated through in silico studies on a patient simulator wherein the patient model is computed based on the data collected from clinical studies.
