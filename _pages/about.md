As a Director of the Control Systems Engineering at [SharkNinja](https://www.sharkninja.com/), I lead the development of intelligent embedded systems across a broad portfolio of consumer products. I established and now manage the Control Systems team within Ninja R&D, overseeing the integration of hardware and software, from early-stage prototyping to mass production. My expertise spans control systems, mechatronics, robotics, and system-level architecture, combining theoretical depth with practical, product-driven execution..

Previously, I served as Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering Technology at [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](https://sunypoly.edu/). Before that, I was a control systems researcher at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where I worked on the [Green Building Innovation Cluster (GBIC)](https://intelligentsystemseee.ntu.edu.sg/cpisrg/gbic/gbic_index.html). In this project, I developed a real-time model identification algorithm to identify the thermal model of rooms and model-based distributed control strategies for HVAC systems to improve energy saving.

I earned my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University (2010), and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University (2015).

My academic and professional interests include system identification, model predictive control, real-time optimization, anomaly detection, signal processing, and time series forecasting, applied to robotics, smart buildings, and intelligent consumer systems. I am an active IEEE member, have published widely in journals and conferences, and have served as associate editor and technical committee member for multiple IEEE events.

Here are some of my key skills and accomplishments:

* Led control system and algorithm development for 20+ mass-market SharkNinja products
* Built and scaled the Control Systems Engineering team from the ground up
* Inventor on 10+ patents related to beverage systems, thermal control, and user experience
* Excellent communication and presentation skills, with experience in presenting technical information to both technical and non-technical audiences.
* Published 20+ peer-reviewed articles on control theory, modeling, and predictive system
