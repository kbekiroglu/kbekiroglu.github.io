I am currently a senior system engineer at SharkNinja and co-founder at Ocean Dynamex. I have experience in control systems, mechatronics, robotics, optimization (robust MPC), the areas of smart buildings, HVAC systems (model predictive control algorithms), time series analysis, predictive analytics, and forecasting algorithms. Before joining the SharkNinja, I was an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering Technology at the College of Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute. Before joining [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](https://sunypoly.edu/), I was was a researcher working on the [Green Building Innovation Cluster (GBIC)](https://intelligentsystemseee.ntu.edu.sg/cpisrg/gbic/gbic_index.html) project at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. In this project, I was responsible for developing a real-time model identification algorithm to identify the thermal model of rooms and model-based distributed control strategies for HVAC systems to improve energy saving.

I received an M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, in 2010, and a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, in 2015. I also have a minor Ph.D. degree in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University. My research experience consists of the broad interface of mechatronics, robotics, system identification (modeling), model predictive control, optimization, robust optimization, building automation, signal processing, predictive analytics, and anomaly detection. I am a member of the IEEE. I have published many journal papers and conference papers and edited conference issues. His leadership experience consists of being an associate editor and technical program committee at the IEEE ICARCV 2018, 2020, a session chair at IEEE ACC 2016, and a reviewer of many IEEE journals and proceedings.
