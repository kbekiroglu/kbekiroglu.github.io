* [Determining an amount of carbon dioxide in a gas source in a carbonation system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240246041A1/en?q=(bekiroglu)&inventor=korkut&oq=korkut+bekiroglu) (US20240246041A1). 
  * Various systems, devices, and methods of determining an amount of carbon dioxide in a gas source in a carbonation system are provided. A carbonation system is one example of a treatment system to which the systems, devices, and methods described herein apply. In general, a carbonation system can be configured to determine an amount of CO2 in a gas source, such as a CO2 canister, removably coupled to the carbonation system. The carbonation system can also be configured to provide a notification (e.g., audible alert and/or visual alert) to a user of the carbonation system indicative of the determined CO2 amount.
* [Beverage carbonation systems](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2024155439A2/en?q=(bekiroglu)&inventor=korkut&oq=korkut+bekiroglu) (WO2024155439A2, WO2024155439A3).
  * Various illustrative systems, devices, and methods for a beverage carbonation system are provided.
