* [Determining an amount of carbon dioxide in a gas source in a carbonation system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240246041A1/en?q=(bekiroglu)&inventor=korkut&oq=korkut+bekiroglu) (US20240246041A1). 
  * Various systems, devices, and methods of determining an amount of carbon dioxide in a gas source in a carbonation system are provided. A carbonation system is one example of a treatment system to which the systems, devices, and methods described herein apply. In general, a carbonation system can be configured to determine an amount of CO2 in a gas source, such as a CO2 canister, removably coupled to the carbonation system. The carbonation system can also be configured to provide a notification (e.g., audible alert and/or visual alert) to a user of the carbonation system indicative of the determined CO2 amount.
* [Beverage carbonation systems](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2024155439A2/en?q=(bekiroglu)&inventor=korkut&oq=korkut+bekiroglu) (WO2024155439A2, WO2024155439A3).
  * Various illustrative systems, devices, and methods for a beverage carbonation system are provided. In general, a carbonation system is configured to form a carbonated fluid and dispense the carbonated fluid into a container, such as a bottle, a cup, or other container. A carbonation system is one example of a treatment system to which the systems, devices, and methods described herein apply.
* [Detecting liquid temperature for a beverage carbonation system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250001371A1/en?q=(bekiroglu)&inventor=korkut&oq=korkut+bekiroglu) (US20250001371A).
  * Various systems, devices, and methods of detecting liquid temperature for a beverage carbonation system are provided. A carbonation system is one example of a treatment system to which the systems, devices, and methods described herein apply. In general, a carbonation system is configured to form a carbonated fluid by mixing a liquid and a gas and dispensing the carbonated fluid into a container. A temperature of the liquid can be detected, e.g., using a temperature sensor, before the liquid and the gas are mixed together to form the carbonated fluid. A user of the carbonation system can be informed of the liquid's temperature before the mixing begins.
