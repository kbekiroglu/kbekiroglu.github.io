dentifying building thermal model with communication imperfections (data-loss and -corruption) is emerging as a major challenge in deploying Internet of Things (IoT) based building automation systems. Further, the building thermal model is influenced by multiple inputs- cooling energy, stray heating, and weather, leading to a multi-input and single output (MISO) system, compounding the challenge further. This investigation presents an approach for identifying high fidelity, yet simple building thermal model suitable for designing predictive controllers for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems with IoT induced imperfections.
